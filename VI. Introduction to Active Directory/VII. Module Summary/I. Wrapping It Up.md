# Wrapping It Up

We've now started down the rabbit hole that is Active Directory. Love it or hate it, if we are to continue down a technical information security path, we will have to deal with Active Directory in some way -- hardening and administering as a security-minded sysadmin, attacking it as a network pentester, defending it as a threat hunter, or performing incident response or digital forensics. Working in any of these roles requires in-depth knowledge of Active Directory. Here we've laid the foundations for the common terms that will pop up again and again as you progress through other Academy modules, other training courses, and infosec in general. Where do we go from here? Check out the accompanying module in our Penetration Tester Path, Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks, that covers manual and automated enumeration and attack techniques that we've seen and used frequently in real-world environments.

## Academy Skills Paths

We also have an Active Directory Enumeration path which features the following modules:

- Active Directory LDAP
- Active Directory PowerView
- Active Directory BloodHound

## Boxes To Pwn, Videos To Help Visualize

The Hack The Box main platform has many targets for learning and practicing AD enumeration and attacks. Some boxes worth checking out are:

- Active
- Resolute
- Forest
- Cascade

Ippsec has recorded videos explaining the paths through many of these boxes and more. If you get stuck or want a great primer dealing with Active Directory and see how some of the tools work, check out the video links above.

## More AD Learning Opportunities

Pro Labs are large simulated corporate networks that teach skills applicable to real-life penetration testing engagements. The Dante Pro Lab is an excellent place to start with varying vectors and some AD exposure. The Offshore Pro Lab is an intermediate-level lab that contains a wealth of opportunities for practicing AD enumeration and common and less common attacks.

There are more advanced Pro Labs available too.

For more practice specific to AD, check out the AD Track as well. Tracks are curated lists of machines and challenges for users to work through and master a particular topic. The AD Track contains boxes of varying difficulties with a variety of attack vectors. Even if you are unable to solve these boxes on your own, it is still worth working with them with a walkthrough or video or just watching the video on the box by Ippsec. The more you expose yourself to these topics, the more comfortable and second nature enumeration and many attacks will become.

## Closing Thoughts

Between the HTB Discord, Forums, and blogs, there are plenty of amazing write-ups to help advance your skills along the way. One to pay attention to would be 0xdf's walkthroughs. These are also a great resource to get an idea of how an Active Directory attack path may look in the real world. 0xdf writes about much more, and his blog is an excellent resource.

We would be remiss not to mention Sean Metcal's amazing Active Directory Security blog. This blog is a treasure trove of information and worth perusing.

It is also worth reading as much about Active Directory security as possible and becoming familiar with the tools and techniques mentioned in the Active Directory timeline earlier in the module. It is a vast topic and will take time to master. A fundamental understanding of AD and the tools surrounding the field, both as a pentester or defender, will make life immeasurably easier, though. Just because BloodHound is billed as a Pentesting tool, that doesn't mean that it can't be a great tool to leverage as a Defender to acquire better visibility into your enterprise and the relationships contained within. The more we understand the bigger picture, how things in enterprise networks are intertwined, and the various ways to attack and harden AD, the more powerful we will become as attackers and defenders, and the more value we can provide to our clients and the companies we work for.
