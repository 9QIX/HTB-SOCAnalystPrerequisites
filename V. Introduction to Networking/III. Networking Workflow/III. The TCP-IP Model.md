# The TCP/IP Model

The `TCP/IP` model is also a layered reference model, often referred to as the `Internet Protocol Suite`. The term `TCP/IP` stands for the two protocols `Transmission Control Protocol` (`TCP`) and `Internet Protocol` (`IP`). `IP` is located within the `network layer` (`Layer 3`) and `TCP` is located within the `transport layer` (`Layer 4`) of the `OSI` layer model.

| Layer          | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4. Application | The Application Layer allows applications to access the other layers' services and defines the protocols applications use to exchange data.                                                                                                      |
| 3. Transport   | The Transport Layer is responsible for providing (TCP) session and (UDP) datagram services for the Application Layer.                                                                                                                            |
| 2. Internet    | The Internet Layer is responsible for host addressing, packaging, and routing functions.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1. Link        | The Link layer is responsible for placing the TCP/IP packets on the network medium and receiving corresponding packets from the network medium. TCP/IP is designed to work independently of the network access method, frame format, and medium. |

With `TCP/IP`, every application can transfer and exchange data over any network, and it does not matter where the receiver is located. `IP` ensures that the data packet reaches its destination, and `TCP` controls the data transfer and ensures the connection between data stream and application. The main difference between `TCP/IP` and `OSI` is the number of layers, some of which have been combined.

The most important tasks of `TCP/IP` are:

| Task                 | Protocol | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical Addressing   | `IP`     | Due to many hosts in different networks, there is a need to structure the network topology and logical addressing. Within TCP/IP, IP takes over the logical addressing of networks and nodes. Data packets only reach the network where they are supposed to be. The methods to do so are `network classes`, `subnetting`, and `CIDR`. |
| Routing              | `IP`     | For each data packet, the next node is determined in each node on the way from the sender to the receiver. This way, a data packet is routed to its receiver, even if its location is unknown to the sender.                                                                                                                           |
| Error & Control Flow | `TCP`    | The sender and receiver are frequently in touch with each other via a virtual connection. Therefore control messages are sent continuously to check if the connection is still established.                                                                                                                                            |
| Application Support  | `TCP`    | TCP and UDP ports form a software abstraction to distinguish specific applications and their communication links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Name Resolution      | `DNS`    | DNS provides name resolution through Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in IP addresses, enabling us to reach the desired host with the specified name on the internet.                                                                                                                                                               |
