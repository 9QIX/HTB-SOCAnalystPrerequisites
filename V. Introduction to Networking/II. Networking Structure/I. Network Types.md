## Network Types

Each network is structured differently and can be set up individually. For this reason, so-called types and topologies have been developed that can be used to categorize these networks. When reading about all the types of networks, it can be a bit of information overload as some network types include the geographical range. We rarely hear some of the terminologies in practice, so this section will be broken up into Common Terms and Book Terms. Book terms are good to know, as there has been a single documented case of an email server failing to deliver emails longer than 500 miles but don't be expected to be able to recite them on demand unless you are studying for a networking exam.
