# Exploitation

During the Exploitation stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the Exploitation stage.

These stages should not be strictly separated from each other, as they are closely connected. Nevertheless, it is still important to distinguish which phase we are in and its purpose. Because later, with much more complex processes and much more information, it is very easy to lose track of the steps that have been taken, especially if the penetration test lasts several weeks and covers a massive scope.

## Prioritization of Possible Attacks

Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the Vulnerability Assessment stage that we can apply to our target network/system, we can prioritize those attacks. Which of those attacks we prioritize higher than the others depends on the following factors:

### Probability of Success

Complexity
Probability of Damage
First, we need to assess the probability of successfully executing a particular attack against the target. CVSS Scoring can help us here, using the NVD calculator better to calculate the specific attacks and their probability of success.

Complexity represents the effort of exploiting a specific vulnerability. This is used to estimate how much time, effort, and research is required to execute the attack on the system successfully. Our experience plays an important role here because if we are to carry out an attack that we have never used before, this will logically require much more research and effort since we must understand the attack and the exploit structure in detail before applying it.

Estimating the probability of damage caused by the execution of an exploit plays a critical role, as we must avoid any damage to the target systems. Generally, we do not perform DoS attacks unless our client requires them. Nevertheless, attacking the running services live with exploits that can cause damage to the software or the operating system is something that we must avoid at all times.

In addition, we can assign these factors to a personal point system which will allow the evaluation to be more accurately calculated based on our skills and knowledge:

### Prioritization Example

| Factor                    | Points  | Remote File Inclusion | Buffer Overflow |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Probability of Success | 10      | 10                    | 8               |
| 2. Complexity - Easy      | 5       | 4                     | 0               |
| 3. Complexity - Medium    | 3       | 0                     | 3               |
| 4. Complexity - Hard      | 1       | 0                     | 0               |
| 5. Probability of Damage  | -5      | 0                     | -5              |
| Summary                   | max. 15 | 14                    | 6               |

Based on the above example, we would prefer the remote file inclusion attack. It is easy to prepare and execute and should not cause any damage if approached carefully.

## Preparation for the Attack

Sometimes we will run into a situation where we can't find high-quality, known working PoC exploit code. Therefore, it may be necessary to reconstruct the exploit locally on a VM representing our target host to figure out precisely what needs to be adapted and changed. Once we have set up the system locally and installed known components to mirror the target environment as closely as possible (i.e., same version numbers for target services/applications), we can start preparing the exploit by following the steps described in the exploit. Then we test this on a locally hosted VM to ensure it works and does not damage significantly. In other situations, we will encounter misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that we see very often and know exactly which tool or exploit to use and whether the exploit or technique is "safe" or can cause instability.

If ever in doubt before running an attack, it's always best to check with our client, providing them all necessary data so they can make an informed decision on whether they would like us to attempt exploitation or just mark the finding as an issue. If they opt for us not to proceed with exploitation, we can note in the report that it was not confirmed actively but is likely an issue that needs to be addressed. We have a certain amount of leeway during penetration tests and should always use our best judgment if a particular attack seems too risky or could potentially cause a disruption. When in doubt, communicate. Your team lead/manager, the client, will almost certainly prefer extra communication than run into a situation where they are trying to bring a system back online after a failed exploit attempt.

Once we have successfully exploited a target and have initial access (and taken clear notes for our reports and logged all activities in our activity log!), we'll move on to the post-exploitation and lateral movement stages.
