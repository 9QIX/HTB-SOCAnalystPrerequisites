# Academy Exercises & Questions

We have all had that one situation during tests, exams, and interviews where we were asked questions that could have several correct answers, but we could not come up with the correct answer. We may think we know the right answer. However, we did not know what the questioner wanted to hear at that moment in time.

At that time, our situation (getting the job, passing the exam) depended on the "right" answer. Our skills were being assessed based on our responses, and they may have even felt like trick questions and seemed unfair and frustrating. There is actual science that deals with what questions are and what types of questions exist, which is discussed in more detail in the Learning Process module. The questions we may have been asked may have been ones that have no honest answer or may even distract us from the train of thought and cause us to stutter mentally.

## The Goal

However, at Hack The Box Academy, we do not judge you by your answers. We also do not want to confuse you or interrupt your thought processes. We do not get anything out of it because we create the material for you so you can learn in the best possible way and gain real experience in this field. Therefore, we have entirely different goals with our questions and exercises than others you may come across in your studies and career.

We want you to link your knowledge with practice and thus create chains of association. None of our questions or exercises stray from the topic taught. The labs and questions that are supposed to put you into scenarios related to our real-world experiences are ideally/directly related to the materials taught.

Some students may find the questions too rough or too imprecise. At first glance, that may seem to be the case. However, if we reconcile the material taught and experiment a little, we will begin to see and understand the context of the content. Once we have recognized these connections, we have already gained experience. All our tasks are always thoroughly thought through. We strive to match each question and skills assessment with the module difficulty level, assumed prerequisite knowledge, and accurately mapped to the presented content.

Some questions will seem unclear at first, but the reality is that we will often not know what to look for during actual penetration test engagements. We also will not know how many vulnerabilities there are to find. So we will be given a rough task:

> Find as many vulnerabilities as possible within the given time.

We want to prepare you for real-world situations and give you the confidence and experience to solve the given tasks. We want you to gain experience. It is impossible without difficulty or making mistakes in practice, which is normal. Some tasks will challenge you, which is okay and a good thing because you will learn the most from the difficult tasks. Every task is easy when you know the answer. But finding the way to the solution is the art.

## Asking for Help

Whether you do it or not is up to you and what you want to achieve. Because in our opinion, with many years together in this field, we know that this difficulty level is by far the best way to see the big picture and become highly skilled. If you get stuck or frustrated in your studies, reach out to others for assistance, there is a whole community out there willing to help, but you have to be willing to put in the work.

Instead of saying "I can't solve X" or "Tell me the answer to X," try approaching things differently. Before asking a question, list out what you already know and what things you have already tried. In doing this, you may find the answer is right in front of you. If you are still stuck, framing your question with this background information will show whoever is helping you that you are putting in an effort and not just looking to "check a box" and move on.

Asking good questions is a difficult skill to master, but it's necessary for us in our studies and careers.

When you have a boss, it's usually best to come to them with a partial solution and ask them to help validate your assumptions instead of just giving you the answer. This will show that you have done your due diligence, and they can count on you to tackle challenging problems that others may shy away from. This attitude will help you immensely throughout your career and is especially beneficial in an uncertain role like a penetration tester, where almost every day, we are faced with complex technical puzzles that we must solve under time constraints, sometimes for needy or unpleasant clients. Keep working hard, learn how to ask for help, and pay it forward to others who are going through what you have experienced and you will go far in this industry.

## Words of Wisdom

Our goal is to make you skilled penetration testers and IT security specialists. It is our passion to share our knowledge with you. We know precisely what you are going through and how it feels. We have all been through these situations.

Stay the course on the material, even if you have difficulty understanding certain things. We have become known for our materials and machines being too tricky for beginners. Of course, without some knowledge, this is true. Nevertheless, that does not stop you from learning the material independently.

Below are some words of insight from each member of the HTB Academy team:

Advice from Cry0l1t3:

> The difficulty is the dimension of your success that you must decide to step into.

Advice from mrb3n:

> Every day is a school day. Try to learn at least one new thing every single day.

Advice from Dimitris:

> Closely monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape and try to understand/emulate the techniques, tactics, and procedures of adversaries in the wild. This way you can provide your future clients/employers with realistic engagements.

Advice from plaintext:

> Keep it simple. Sometimes challenges can be complex, but the answers might be right in front of you. If you have a hunch, follow it before trying something more advanced.

Advice from pedant:

> Sophistication breeds excellence; excellence breeds sophistication.

Advice from 21y4d:

> The difference between your skill level and the module exercises is the amount you should improve. As you complete the path and review earlier exercises, you'll see that you can easily complete them, indicating your skill level has increased.

Advice from LTNB0B:

> If you truly want to accomplish what you set your mind to, remain persistent! Keep learning, and know that persistence pays off!

Advice from TreyCraf7:

> Don't be afraid to ask questions. Getting a peer or mentor's perspective on a problem can help you get back on track. Sometimes it just takes another set of eyes.

Advice from sentinal:

> Staying in your comfort zone is easy. Challenging your potential will keep you moving forward.

We wish you all the best on your journey and know that we will be here to support you in Discord and will constantly strive to release materials to help you reach and exceed your goals. The HTB Discord community is an excellent resource if you get stuck, are looking for a study partner, want to share a cool achievement, or need someone to chat with. Definitely take advantage of it.

With that being said, let's discuss what a penetration test is and the various types of penetration tests we may be asked to perform.
