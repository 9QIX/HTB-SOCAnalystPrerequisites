### Introduction to Windows

As a penetration tester, understanding Windows operating systems is crucial for various assessment types. Windows, alongside Linux, constitutes a significant portion of systems encountered during assessments, whether on-premise or in the cloud. Having a grasp of how to both attack and defend Windows systems is essential for effective penetration testing activities.

#### The Windows Operating System

Microsoft introduced the Windows operating system on November 20, 1985. Initially serving as a graphical shell for MS-DOS, Windows evolved over the years. Windows 95 marked the integration of Windows and DOS, offering built-in Internet support and debuting Internet Explorer. Subsequent versions, including Windows XP, Vista, 8, and the current Windows 10, introduced various features catering to different user segments, from casual consumers to enterprise customers.

Windows Server, starting with Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server in 1993, underwent significant updates, introducing technologies like Internet Information Services (IIS) and Active Directory. With each iteration, new features and enhancements, such as failover clustering, Hyper-V virtualization, and advanced security features, were introduced, culminating in the latest release, Windows Server 2019.

#### Windows Versions

Windows versions are identified by version numbers associated with their respective names. Here's a list of major Windows operating systems and their version numbers:

Here's the information presented in a Markdown table:

| Operating System Name                | Version Number |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Windows NT 4                         | 4.0            |
| Windows 2000                         | 5.0            |
| Windows XP                           | 5.1            |
| Windows Server 2003, 2003 R2         | 5.2            |
| Windows Vista, Server 2008           | 6.0            |
| Windows 7, Server 2008 R2            | 6.1            |
| Windows 8, Server 2012               | 6.2            |
| Windows 8.1, Server 2012 R2          | 6.3            |
| Windows 10, Server 2016, Server 2019 | 10.0           |

This table provides a summary of various Windows operating systems along with their version numbers.

#### Accessing Windows

Accessing Windows systems involves local or remote access. Local access is the most common, where input and output occur through physical devices like keyboards, mice, and displays. Remote access, on the other hand, involves accessing a computer over a network. Common remote access methods include Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Secure Shell (SSH), and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

#### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

RDP enables remote access to Windows systems over a network. It utilizes a client/server architecture, with the target computer being the server. RDP listens on port 3389 by default. Remote Desktop Connection, the built-in RDP client in Windows, allows users to connect to remote systems conveniently. Tools like xfreerdp facilitate RDP connections from Linux-based hosts, providing efficiency and flexibility.

Understanding Windows operating systems, accessing them locally or remotely, and leveraging tools like RDP are essential skills for penetration testers to effectively assess Windows environments.
