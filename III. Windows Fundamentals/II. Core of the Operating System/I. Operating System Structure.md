### Operating System Structure

In Windows operating systems, the directory structure is crucial for organizing and accessing system files and user data. Let's explore the main directories and their functions:

| Directory                      | Function                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perflogs**                   | Holds Windows performance logs but is typically empty by default.                                            |
| **Program Files**              | On 32-bit systems, hosts all 16-bit and 32-bit programs. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are stored. |
| **Program Files (x86)**        | Dedicated for 32-bit and 16-bit programs on 64-bit editions of Windows.                                      |
| **ProgramData**                | Contains essential data for certain installed programs to function, accessible by any user.                  |
| **Users**                      | Stores user profiles for each system user, including Default and Public folders.                             |
| **Default**                    | Serves as the default user profile template for new user accounts.                                           |
| **Public**                     | Intended for file sharing among computer users, accessible to all users by default.                          |
| **AppData**                    | Stores per-user application data and settings, including Roaming, Local, and LocalLow subfolders.            |
| **Windows**                    | Houses most of the files required for the Windows operating system to function.                              |
| **System, System32, SysWOW64** | Contains essential DLLs for core Windows features and API functionality.                                     |
| **WinSxS**                     | The Windows Component Store holds copies of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.              |

#### Exploring Directories Using Command Line

We can navigate and explore the file system using various command-line utilities:

- **dir**: Displays directory contents.
- **tree**: Graphically displays directory structure.

Example commands:

```bash
# Display directory contents of C drive
dir c:\ /a

# Display directory structure of a specific path
tree "c:\Program Files (x86)\VMware"
```

These commands provide insights into the file system layout and help manage files and directories effectively.
