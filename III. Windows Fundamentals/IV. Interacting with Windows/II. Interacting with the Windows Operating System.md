# Interacting with the Windows Operating System

## Graphical User Interface

The concept of a graphical user interface (GUI) was introduced in the late 1970s by the Xerox Palo Alto research laboratory. It was added to Apple and Microsoft operating systems to address usability concerns for everyday users that would likely have difficulty navigating the command line. Most casual Windows computer users do not ever need to interact with the operating system via the command line. As the name alludes to, a GUI provides users with an interactive point and click interface for interacting with the operating system and installed applications and services.

The introduction of the GUI opened up widespread appeal and access to computers across many demographics since users would be able to interact with their computer without having to memorize commands or know any programming language. Systems administrators commonly use GUI-based systems for administering Active Directory, configuring IIS, or interacting with databases.

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

RDP is a proprietary Microsoft protocol which allows a user to connect to a remote system over a network connection and obtain a graphical user interface. The user connects using RDP client software to a target system running RDP server software. RDP uses port 3389 to open a dedicated network channel for sending data back and forth. When connecting via RDP, a user can access the GUI as if they were actually sitting at the computer and logging into it locally. RDP is often used by system administrators to administer remote systems quickly. It can also allow users to access their work computers when traveling or working from home after connecting to a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

## Windows Command Line

Command-line interfaces give users greater control over their systems and can be used to perform a wide variety of day-to-day, administrative, and troubleshooting tasks. It can be leveraged to introduce automation to perform certain tasks quickly (such as adding many users to a domain at once). In Windows operating systems, the main two ways to interact with the system from the command line are via the Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell.

The Windows Command Reference from Microsoft is a comprehensive A-Z command reference which includes an overview, usage examples, and command syntax for most Windows commands, and familiarity with it is recommended.

### CMD

The Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is used to enter and execute commands. A user can enter one-off commands such as `ipconfig` to view IP address information or perform more advanced tasks such as setting up scheduled tasks or creating scripts and batch files. The Command prompt can be opened from the Start Menu, by typing `cmd` in the run dialogue box, or by directly launching the binary from `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe`.

After launching `cmd.exe` we can type `help` to see a listing of available commands.

### PowerShell

Windows PowerShell is a command shell that was designed by Microsoft to be more geared towards system administrators. PowerShell, like the Windows command line, has an interactive command prompt as well as a powerful scripting environment. PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework, which is used for building and running applications on Windows. This makes it a very powerful tool for interfacing directly with the operating system.

Like the command prompt, PowerShell gives us direct access to the file system, and we run the majority of the same commands that we can within a cmd shell.

#### Cmdlets

PowerShell utilizes cmdlets, which are small single-function tools built into the shell. There are more than 100 core cmdlets, and many additional ones have been written, or we can author our own to perform more complex tasks. PowerShell also supports both simple and complex scripts used for system administration tasks, automation, and more.

Cmdlets are in the form of `Verb-Noun`. For example, the command `Get-ChildItem` can be used to list our current directory. Cmdlets also take arguments or flags. We can type `Get-ChildItem -` and hit the tab key to iterate through the arguments. A command such as `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` will show us the contents of our current working directory and all subdirectories. Another example would be `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Documents` to get the contents of another directory. Finally, we can combine arguments such as this to list all subdirectories' contents within another directory recursively: `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads -Recurse`.

#### Aliases

Many cmdlets in PowerShell also have aliases. For example, the aliases for the cmdlet `Set-Location`, to change directories, is either `cd` or `sl`. Meanwhile, the aliases for `Get-ChildItem` are `ls` and `gci`. We can view all available aliases by typing `Get-Alias`.

```powershell
  Interacting with the Windows Operating System
PS C:\htb> get-alias

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           % -> ForEach-Object
Alias           ? -> Where-Object
Alias           ac -> Add-Content
Alias           asnp -> Add-PSSnapin
Alias           cat -> Get-Content
Alias           cd -> Set-Location
Alias           CFS -> ConvertFrom-String                          3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
Alias           chdir -> Set-Location
Alias           clc -> Clear-Content
Alias           clear -> Clear-Host
Alias           clhy -> Clear-History
Alias           cli -> Clear-Item
Alias           clp -> Clear-ItemProperty
```

We can also set up our own aliases with `New-Alias` and get the alias for any cmdlet with `Get-Alias -Name`.

```powershell
  Interacting with the Windows Operating System
PS C:\htb> New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
PS C:\> Get-Alias -Name "Show-Files"

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           Show-Files
```

PowerShell has a help system for cmdlets, functions, scripts, and concepts. This is not installed by default, but we can either run the `Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Online` command to open the online help for a cmdlet or function in our web browser. We can type `Update-Help` to download and install help files locally.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> help

TOPIC
    Windows PowerShell Help System

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Displays help about Windows PowerShell cmdlets and concepts.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Windows PowerShell Help describes Windows PowerShell cmdlets,
    functions, scripts, and modules, and explains concepts, including
    the elements of the Windows PowerShell language.

    Windows PowerShell does not include help files, but you can read the
    help topics online, or use the Update-Help cmdlet to download help files
    to your computer and then use the Get-Help cmdlet to display the help
    topics at the command line.

    You can also use the Update-Help cmdlet to download updated help files
    as they are released so that your local help content is never obsolete.

    Without help files, Get-Help displays auto-generated help for cmdlets,
    functions, and scripts.


  ONLINE HELP
    You can find help for Windows PowerShell online in the TechNet Library
    beginning at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=108518.

    To open online help for any cmdlet or function, type:

        Get-Help <cmdlet-name> -Online

<SNIP>
```

Typing a command such as `Get-Help Get-AppPackage` will return just the partial help unless the Help files are installed.

```powershell
PS C:\htb>  Get-Help Get-AppPackage

NAME
    Get-AppxPackage

SYNTAX
    Get-AppxPackage [[-Name] <string>] [[-Publisher] <string>] [-AllUsers] [-PackageTypeFilter {None | Main |
    Framework | Resource | Bundle | Xap | Optional | All}] [-User <string>] [-Volume <AppxVolume>]
    [<CommonParameters>]


ALIASES
    Get-AppPackage


REMARKS
    Get-Help cannot find the Help files for this cmdlet on this computer. It is displaying only partial help.
        -- To download and install Help files for the module that includes this cmdlet, use Update-Help.
```

#### Running Scripts

The PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) allows users to write PowerShell scripts on the fly. It also has an autocomplete/lookup function for PowerShell commands. The PowerShell ISE allows us to write and run scripts in the same console, which allows for quick debugging.

We can run PowerShell scripts in a variety of ways. If we know the functions, we can run the script either locally or after loading into memory with a download cradle like the below example.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\PowerView.ps1;Get-LocalGroup |fl

Description     : Users of Docker Desktop
Name            : docker-users
SID             : S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1004
PrincipalSource : Local
ObjectClass     : Group

Description     : VMware User Group
Name            : __vmware__
SID             : S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1003
PrincipalSource : Local
ObjectClass     : Group

Description     : Members of this group can remotely query authorization attributes and permissions for resources on
                  this computer.
Name            : Access Control Assistance Operators
SID             : S-1-5-32-579
PrincipalSource : Local
ObjectClass     : Group

Description     : Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain
Name            : Administrators
SID             : S-1-5-32-544
PrincipalSource : Local

<SNIP>
```

One common way to work with a script in PowerShell is to import it so that all functions are then available within our current PowerShell console session: `Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1`. We can then either start a command and cycle through the options or type `Get-Module` to list all loaded modules and their associated commands.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-Module | select Name,ExportedCommands | fl


Name             : Appx
ExportedCommands : {[Add-AppxPackage, Add-AppxPackage], [Add-AppxVolume, Add-AppxVolume], [Dismount-AppxVolume,
                   Dismount-AppxVolume], [Get-AppxDefaultVolume, Get-AppxDefaultVolume]...}

Name             : Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts
ExportedCommands : {[Add-LocalGroupMember, Add-LocalGroupMember], [Disable-LocalUser, Disable-LocalUser],
                   [Enable-LocalUser, Enable-LocalUser], [Get-LocalGroup, Get-LocalGroup]...}

Name             : Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
ExportedCommands : {[Add-Computer, Add-Computer], [Add-Content, Add-Content], [Checkpoint-Computer,
                   Checkpoint-Computer], [Clear-Content, Clear-Content]...}

Name             : Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
ExportedCommands : {[Add-Member, Add-Member], [Add-Type, Add-Type], [Clear-Variable, Clear-Variable], [Compare-Object,
                   Compare-Object]...}

Name             : PSReadline
ExportedCommands : {[Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler], [Get-PSReadLineOption,
                   Get-PSReadLineOption], [Remove-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Remove-PSReadLineKeyHandler],
                   [Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler]...}
```

#### Execution Policy

Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature called the execution policy, which attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The possible policies are:
Here's the information presented in a Markdown table:

| Policy       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AllSigned    | All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted. |
| Bypass       | No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Default      | This sets the default execution policy, Restricted for Windows desktop machines and RemoteSigned for Windows servers.                                                                                                                                            |
| RemoteSigned | Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.                                                                                     |
| Restricted   | This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (.ps1xml), module script files (.psm1), and PowerShell profiles (.ps1) are blocked.                                                   |
| Undefined    | No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of Restricted will be used.                                                                                      |
| Unrestricted | This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone.                                 |

Below is an example of the current execution policy for all scopes.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

The execution policy is not meant to be a security control that restricts user actions. A user can easily bypass the policy by either typing the script contents directly into the PowerShell window, downloading and invoking the script, or specifying the script as an encoded command. It can also be bypassed by adjusting the execution policy (if the user has the proper rights) or setting the execution policy for the current process scope (which can be done by almost any user as it does not require a configuration change and will only be set for the duration of the user's session).

Below is an example of changing the execution policy for the current process (session).

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
```

We can now see that the execution policy has been changed.

```powershell
PS C:\htb>  Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process          Bypass
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```
