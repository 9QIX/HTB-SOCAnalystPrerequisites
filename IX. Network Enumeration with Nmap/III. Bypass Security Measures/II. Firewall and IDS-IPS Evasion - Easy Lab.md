**Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Easy Lab**

Now let's get practical. A company hired us to test their IT security defenses, including their `IDS` and `IPS` systems. Our client wants to increase their IT security and will, therefore, make specific improvements to their `IDS/IPS` systems after each successful test. We do not know, however, according to which guidelines these changes will be made. Our goal is to find out specific information from the given situations.

We are only ever provided with a machine protected by `IDS/IPS` systems and can be tested. For learning purposes and to get a feel for how `IDS/IPS` can behave, we have access to a status web page at:

This page shows us the number of alerts. We know that if we receive a specific amount of alerts, we will be `banned`. Therefore we have to test the target system as `quietly` as possible.
