# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

With our second test's help, our client was able to gain new insights and sent one of its administrators to a training course for IDS/IPS systems. As our client told us, the training would last one week. Now the administrator has taken all the necessary precautions and wants us to test this again because specific services must be changed, and the communication for the provided software had to be modified.

## Question

Now our client wants to know if it is possible to find out the version of the running services. Identify the version of service our client was talking about and submit the flag as the answer.
