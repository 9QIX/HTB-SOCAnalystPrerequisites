# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

With our second test's help, our client was able to gain new insights and sent one of its administrators to a training course for IDS/IPS systems. As our client told us, the training would last one week. Now the administrator has taken all the necessary precautions and wants us to test this again because specific services must be changed, and the communication for the provided software had to be modified.
