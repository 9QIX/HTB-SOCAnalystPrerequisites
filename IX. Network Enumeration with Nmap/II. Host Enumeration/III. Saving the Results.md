# Saving the Results

## Different Formats

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. Nmap can save the results in 3 different formats.

- Normal output (-oN) with the .nmap file extension
- Grepable output (-oG) with the .gnmap file extension
- XML output (-oX) with the .xml file extension

We can also specify the option (-oA) to save the results in all formats. The command could look like this:

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 12:14 CEST

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.129.2.28      | Scans the specified target.                                                     |
| -p-              | Scans all ports.                                                                |
| -oA target       | Saves the results in all formats, starting the name of each file with 'target'. |

If no full path is given, the results will be stored in the directory we are currently in. Next, we look at the different formats Nmap has created for us.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ ls

target.gnmap target.xml  target.nmap
```

## Normal Output

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ cat target.nmap

# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28

## Grepable Output

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ cat target.gnmap

# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28

## Style sheets

With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool xsltproc.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

If we now open the HTML file in our browser, we see a clear and structured presentation of our results.
