# Nmap Scripting Engine

Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is another handy feature of Nmap. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

| Category  | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| auth      | Determination of authentication credentials.                                                                                            |
| broadcast | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. |
| brute     | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.                                        |
| default   | Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.                                                                                       |
| discovery | Evaluation of accessible services.                                                                                                      |
| dos       | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.              |
| exploit   | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.                                                   |
| external  | Scripts that use external services for further processing.                                                                              |
| fuzzer    | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.     |
| intrusive | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.                                                                       |
| malware   | Checks if some malware infects the target system.                                                                                       |
| safe      | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.                                                                 |
| version   | Extension for service detection.                                                                                                        |
| vuln      | Identification of specific vulnerabilities.                                                                                             |

We have several ways to define the desired scripts in Nmap.

## Default Scripts

```bash
$ sudo nmap <target> -sC
```

## Specific Scripts Category

```bash
$ sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
```

## Defined Scripts

```bash
$ sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...
```

For example, let us keep working with the target SMTP port and see the results we get with two defined scripts.

### Nmap - Specifying Scripts

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 23:21 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28

|_banner: 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)
|_smtp-commands: inlane, PIPELINING, SIZE 10240000, VRFY, ETRN, STARTTLS, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, 8BITMIME, DSN, SMTPUTF8,

```

| Scanning Options              | Description                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 10.129.2.28                   | Scans the specified target.    |
| -p 25                         | Scans only the specified port. |
| --script banner,smtp-commands | Uses specified NSE scripts.    |

We see that we can recognize the Ubuntu distribution of Linux by using the 'banner' script. The smtp-commands script shows us which commands we can use by interacting with the target SMTP server. In this example, such information may help us to find out existing users on the target. Nmap also gives us the ability to scan our target with the aggressive option (-A). This scans the target with multiple options as service detection (-sV), OS detection (-O), traceroute (--traceroute), and with the default NSE scripts (-sC).

### Nmap - Aggressive Scan

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-17 01:38 CEST

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.129.2.28      | Scans the specified target.                                                                        |
| -p 25            | Scans only the specified port.                                                                     |
| -A               | Performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute and uses defaults scripts to scan the target. |

With the help of the used scan option (-A), we found out what kind of web server (Apache 2.4.29) is running on the system, which web application (WordPress 5.3.4) is used, and the title (blog.inlanefreight.com) of the web page. Also, Nmap shows that it is likely to be Linux (96%) operating system.

## Vulnerability Assessment

Now let us move on to HTTP port 80 and see what information and vulnerabilities we can find using the vuln category from NSE.

### Nmap - Vuln Category

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln

| Scanning Options | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10.129.2.28      | Scans the specified target.                            |
| -p 80            | Scans only the specified port.                         |
| -sV              | Performs service version detection on specified ports. |
| --script vuln    | Uses all related scripts from specified category.      |

The scripts used for the last scan interact with the webserver and its web application to find out more information about their versions and check various databases to see if there are known vulnerabilities. More information about NSE scripts and the corresponding categories we can find at: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/index.html
