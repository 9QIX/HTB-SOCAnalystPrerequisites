# Host and Port Scanning

It is essential to understand how the tool we use works and how it performs and processes the different functions. We will only understand the results if we know what they mean and how they are obtained. Therefore we will take a closer look at and analyze some of the scanning methods. After we have found out that our target is alive, we want to get a more accurate picture of the system. The information we need includes:

- Open ports and its services
- Service versions
- Information that the services provided
- Operating system

There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

| State            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| open             | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.                                    |
| closed           | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
| filtered         | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.                |
| unfiltered       | This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.                                             |
| open\|filtered   | If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.                                                |
| closed\|filtered | This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.                                             |

## Discovering Open TCP Ports

By default, Nmap scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the Nmap database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).

### Scanning Top 10 TCP Ports

| `--top-ports=10` | Scans the specified top ports that have been defined as most frequent. |

We see that we only scanned the top 10 TCP ports of our target, and Nmap displays their state accordingly. If we trace the packets Nmap sends, we will see the RST flag on TCP port 21 that our target sends back to us. To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).

We can see from the `SENT` line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the SYN flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next `RCVD` line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the RST and ACK flags (`RA`). RST and ACK flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (ACK) and to end the TCP session (RST).

### Connect Scan

The Nmap TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed. The scan sends an SYN packet to the target port and waits for a response. It is considered open if the target port responds with an SYN-ACK packet and closed if it responds with an RST packet.

The Connect scan is useful because it is the most accurate way to determine the state of a port, and it is also the most stealthy. Unlike other types of scans, such as the SYN scan, the Connect scan does not leave any unfinished connections or unsent packets on the target host, which makes it less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS). It is useful when we want to map the network and don't want to disturb the services running behind it, ```markdown
thus causing a minimal impact and sometimes considered a more polite scan method.

It is also useful when the target host has a personal firewall that drops incoming packets but allows outgoing packets. In this case, a Connect scan can bypass the firewall and accurately determine the state of the target ports. However, it is important to note that the Connect scan is slower than other types of scans because it requires the scanner to wait for a response from the target after each packet it sends, which could take some time if the target is busy or unresponsive.

### Connect Scan on TCP Port 443

### Filtered Ports

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be dropped, or rejected. When a packet gets dropped, Nmap receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to 1. This means Nmap will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was not accidentally mishandled.

Let us look at an example where the firewall drops the TCP packets we send for the port scan. Therefore we scan the TCP port 139, which was already shown as filtered. To be able to track how our sent packets are handled, we deactivate the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`) again.

```

We see in the last scan that Nmap sent two TCP packets with the SYN flag. By the duration (2.06s) of the scan, we can recognize that it took much longer than the previous ones (~0.05s). The case is different if the firewall rejects the packets. For this, we look at TCP port 445, which is handled accordingly by such a rule of the firewall.

As a response, we receive an ICMP reply with type 3 and error code 3, which indicates that the desired port is unreachable. Nevertheless, if we know that the host is alive, we can strongly assume that the firewall on this port is rejecting the packets, and we will have to take a closer look at this port later.

## Discovering Open UDP Ports

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since UDP is a stateless protocol and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole UDP scan (`-sU`) much slower than the TCP scan (`-sS`).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (`-sU`) can look like and what results it gives us.

### UDP Port Scan

```

| `-sU`            | Performs a UDP scan.        |

Another disadvantage of this is that we often do not get a response back because Nmap sends empty datagrams to the scanned UDP ports, and we do not receive any response. So we cannot determine if the UDP packet has arrived at all or not. If the UDP port is open, we only get a response if the application is configured to do so.

| Scanning Options     | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.129.2.28`        | Scans the specified target.                          |
| `-sU`                | Performs a UDP scan.                                 |
| `-Pn`                | Disables ICMP Echo requests.                         |
| `-n`                 | Disables DNS resolution.                             |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Disables ARP ping.                                   |
| `--packet-trace`     | Shows all packets sent and received.                 |
| `-p 138`             | Scans only the specified port.                       |
| `--reason`           | Displays the reason a port is in a particular state. |

Another handy method for scanning ports is the `-sV` option which is used to get additional available information from the open ports. This method can identify versions, service names, and details about our target.
