# Host Discovery

When we need to conduct an internal penetration test for the entire network of a company, for example, then we should, first of all, get an overview of which systems are online that we can work with. To actively discover such systems on the network, we can use various Nmap host discovery options. There are many options Nmap provides to determine whether our target is alive or not. The most effective host discovery method is to use ICMP echo requests, which we will look into.

It is always recommended to store every single scan. This can later be used for comparison, documentation, and reporting. After all, different tools may produce different results. Therefore it can be beneficial to distinguish which tool produces which results.

## Scan Network Range

### Host Discovery

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

| Scanning Options | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.129.2.0/24    | Target network range.                                            |
| -sn              | Disables port scanning.                                          |
| -oA tnet         | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'. |

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "Firewall and IDS Evasion".

## Scan IP List

During an internal penetration test, it is not uncommon for us to be provided with an IP list with the hosts we need to test. Nmap also gives us the option of working with lists and reading the hosts from this list instead of manually defining or typing them in.

Such a list could look something like this:

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

If we use the same scanning technique on the predefined list, the command will look like this:

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

| Scanning Options | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -sn              | Disables port scanning.                                              |
| -oA tnet         | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.     |
| -iL              | Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list. |

In this example, we see that only 3 of 7 hosts are active. Remember, this may mean that the other hosts ignore the default ICMP echo requests because of their firewall configurations. Since Nmap does not receive a response, it marks those hosts as inactive.

## Scan Multiple IPs

It can also happen that we only need to scan a small part of a network. An alternative to the method we used last time is to specify multiple IP addresses.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

If these IP addresses are next to each other, we can also define the range in the respective octet.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

## Scan Single IP

Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host

| Scanning Options | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.129.2.18      | Performs defined scans against the target.                       |
| -sn              | Disables port scanning.                                          |
| -oA host         | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'. |

If we disable port scan (-sn), Nmap automatically ping scan with ICMP Echo Requests (-PE). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an ICMP reply if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an ARP ping resulting in an ARP reply. We can confirm this with the "--packet-trace" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (-PE) for this.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

| --packet-trace   | Shows all packets sent and received                                      |

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "--reason" option.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10.129.2.18      | Performs defined scans against the target.                               |
| -sn              | Disables port scanning.                                                  |
| -oA host         | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.         |
| -PE              | Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target. |
| --reason         | Displays the reason for specific result.                                 |

We see here that Nmap does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the ARP request and ARP reply alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired ICMP echo requests, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "--disable-arp-ping" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.

```bash
z0x9n@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping

```

We have already mentioned in the "Learning Process," and at the beginning of this module, it is essential to pay attention to details. An ICMP echo request can help us determine if our target is alive and identify its system. More strategies about host discovery can be found at:
