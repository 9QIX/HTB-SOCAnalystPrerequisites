## Backup and Restore ðŸ”„

Linux systems offer robust tools for backing up and restoring data securely and efficiently. Here's how you can leverage some of these tools on Ubuntu:

### Tools for Backup:

- **Rsync:** Efficiently backs up files and folders to a remote location, transmitting only changed parts of files.
- **Duplicity:** Provides comprehensive data protection and secure backups, supporting encryption and storage on various remote media.
- **Deja Dup:** Simplifies the backup process with a user-friendly interface, utilizing Rsync as a backend and supporting data encryption.

### Installing Rsync:

```bash
sudo apt install rsync -y
```

### Backup with Rsync:

```bash
rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

### Advanced Backup with Rsync:

```bash
rsync -avz --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backup/folder --delete /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

### Encrypted Rsync with SSH:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

### Auto-Synchronization with Cron and Rsync:

1. Create a script named `RSYNC_Backup.sh` with the rsync command.
2. Provide execute permission to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x RSYNC_Backup.sh
   ```
3. Edit the crontab to schedule the script:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line to run the script hourly:
   ```bash
   0 * * * * /path/to/RSYNC_Backup.sh
   ```

By automating backups and ensuring encryption, you can protect your data and keep it synchronized across systems effectively.
