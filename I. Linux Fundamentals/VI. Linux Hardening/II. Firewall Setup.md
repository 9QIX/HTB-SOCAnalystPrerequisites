### Firewall Setup üõ°Ô∏è

The primary goal of firewalls is to provide a security mechanism for controlling and monitoring network traffic between different network segments, such as internal and external networks or different network zones. Firewalls play a crucial role in protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, and other security threats. Linux, being a popular operating system used in servers and other network devices, provides built-in firewall capabilities that can be used to control network traffic. In other words, they can filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined rules, protocols, ports, and other criteria to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate security threats. The specific goal of a firewall implementation can vary depending on the specific needs of the organization, such as ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.

An example from the history of Linux firewalls is the development of the iptables tool, which replaced the earlier ipchains and ipfwadm tools. The iptables utility was first introduced in the Linux 2.4 kernel in 2000 and provided a flexible and efficient mechanism for filtering network traffic. iptables became the de facto standard firewall solution for Linux systems, and it has been widely adopted by many organizations and users.

The iptables utility provided a simple yet powerful command-line interface for configuring firewall rules, which could be used to filter traffic based on various criteria such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more. iptables was designed to be highly customizable and could be used to create complex firewall rulesets that could protect against various security threats such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, port scans, and network intrusion attempts.

In Linux, the firewall functionality is typically implemented using the Netfilter framework, which is an integral part of the kernel. Netfilter provides a set of hooks that can be used to intercept and modify network traffic as it passes through the system. The iptables utility is commonly used to configure the firewall rules on Linux systems.

#### Iptables

The iptables utility provides a flexible set of rules for filtering network traffic based on various criteria such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and more. There also exist other solutions like nftables, ufw, and firewalld. Nftables provides a more modern syntax and improved performance over iptables. However, the syntax of nftables rules is not compatible with iptables, so migration to nftables requires some effort. UFW stands for ‚ÄúUncomplicated Firewall‚Äù and provides a simple and user-friendly interface for configuring firewall rules. UFW is built on top of the iptables framework like nftables and provides an easier way to manage firewall rules. Finally, FirewallD provides a dynamic and flexible firewall solution that can be used to manage complex firewall configurations, and it supports a rich set of rules for filtering network traffic and can be used to create custom firewall zones and services.

#### Tables

When working with firewalls on Linux systems, it is important to understand how tables work in iptables. Tables in iptables are used to categorize and organize firewall rules based on the type of traffic that they are designed to handle. These tables are used to organize and categorize firewall rules. Each table is responsible for performing a specific set of tasks.

| Table Name | Description                                                                 | Built-in Chains                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| filter     | Used to filter network traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. | INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD                          |
| nat        | Used to modify the source or destination IP addresses of network packets.   | PREROUTING, POSTROUTING                         |
| mangle     | Used to modify the header fields of network packets.                        | PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING |

In addition to the built-in tables, iptables provides a fourth table called the raw table, which is used to configure special packet processing options. The raw table contains two built-in chains: PREROUTING and OUTPUT.

#### Chains

In iptables, chains organize rules that define how network traffic should be filtered or modified. There are two types of chains in iptables:

- Built-in chains
- User-defined chains

The built-in chains are pre-defined and automatically created when a table is created. Each table has a different set of built-in chains. For example, the filter table has three built-in chains:

- INPUT
- OUTPUT
- FORWARD

These chains are used to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, as well as traffic that is being forwarded between different network interfaces. The nat table has two built-in chains:

- PREROUTING
- POSTROUTING

The PREROUTING chain is used to modify the destination IP address of incoming packets before the routing table processes them. The POSTROUTING chain is used to modify the source IP address of outgoing packets after the routing table has processed them. The mangle table has five built-in chains:

- PREROUTING
- OUTPUT
- INPUT
- FORWARD
- POSTROUTING

These chains are used to modify the header fields of
