  ```bash
  id
  ```

- **`hostname`**: Prints or sets the name of the current host system.

  ```bash
  hostname
  ```

- **`uname`**: Prints basic information about the operating system name and system hardware.

  ```bash
  uname -a
  ```

- **`pwd`**: Returns the working directory name.

  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

- **`ifconfig`**: Assigns or views an address to a network interface and/or configures network interface parameters.

  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```

- **`ip`**: Shows or manipulates routing, network devices, interfaces, and tunnels.

  ```bash
  ip
  ```

- **`netstat`**: Displays network status.

  ```bash
  netstat
  ```

- **`ss`**: Another utility to investigate sockets.

  ```bash
  ss
  ```

- **`ps`**: Shows process status.

  ```bash
  ps
  ```

- **`who`**: Displays information about who is currently logged in.

  ```bash
  who
  ```

- **`env`**: Prints environment variables or sets and executes commands.

  ```bash
  env
  ```

- **`lsblk`**: Lists block devices.

  ```bash
  lsblk
  ```

- **`lsusb`**: Lists USB devices.

  ```bash
  lsusb
  ```

- **`lsof`**: Lists opened files.

  ```bash
  lsof
  ```

- **`lspci`**: Lists PCI devices.

  ```bash
  lspci
  ```

## Examples:

### **Hostname:**

```bash
hostname
```

### **Whoami:**

```bash
whoami
```

### **Id:**

```bash
id
```

### **Uname:**

```bash
uname -a
```

### **Kernel Release (Uname):**

```bash
uname -r
```

### **SSH Login:**

```bash
ssh [username]@[IP address]
```

## Understanding `uname`:

- `uname` provides various options:
  - `-s, --kernel-name`: Print the kernel name.
  - `-n, --nodename`: Print the network node hostname.
  - `-r, --kernel-release`: Print the kernel release.
  - `-v, --kernel-version`: Print the kernel version.
  - `-m, --machine`: Print the machine hardware name.
  - `-p, --processor`: Print the processor type (non-portable).
  - `-i, --hardware-platform`: Print the hardware platform (non-portable).
  - `-o, --operating-system`: Print the operating system.

## Quick Insight into `uname`:

```bash
uname -a
```

This command provides comprehensive system information, including the kernel name, hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware, and operating system.
