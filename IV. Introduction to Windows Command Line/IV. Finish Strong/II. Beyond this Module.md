# Beyond this Module

As a junior penetration tester or sysadmin, one could expect the tasks in this module to be everyday tasks for you to take action on. Sometimes under direct guidance and supervision, sometimes not. A deep understanding of Windows, its CLI, and what we can glean from it (access and enumeration-wise) is essential to fulfilling the role's duties. By the end of the skills assessment, we should feel comfortable accessing and operating in a windows environment without access to a GUI. Using CLI to take care of administrative tasks can increase our workflow and allow us to spend more time working on the things that require more attention. What can we do next to continue our learning journey in the wide world of Windows?

What's Next?
Check out the Setting Up module to better understand how to configure and automate your own custom-built Windows hosts. Also, check out the Introduction to Active Directory module to get a feel for how AD environments work. As an admin and pentester, you will undoubtedly run into Active Directory over and over again wherever you are, as it's a standard for directory services in many organizations' environments.

More Windows Learning Opportunities
The Hack The Box main platform has many targets for learning and practicing against Windows hosts. The Beginner Track on the main HTB platform is an excellent resource for practice. Tracks are curated lists of machines and challenges for users to work through and master a particular topic. The Beginner Track contains three easy-level Windows boxes to test your new command-line skills against. Even if you cannot solve these boxes alone, it is still worth working on them with a walkthrough or video to get a feeling for common Windows misconfigurations and attack paths. The more you expose yourself to these topics, the more comfortable and second nature CLI use will become. The boxes below are also great for practicing the skills learned in this module.

Starting Point
Starting Point is a great chance to start hacking Windows and Linux hosts in a guided fashion. The labs are great for those starting out with pentesting and do a great job explaining why you are doing the things you are. We highlight this so you can get a chance to practice your command-line kung fu in a challenge-based scenario, much like the main boxes released on the main platform.

Boxes to Pwn

- Blue
- Support
- Return

Ippsec has recorded videos explaining the paths through many of these boxes and more. As a resource, Ippsec's site is a great way to search for videos and write-ups pertaining to many different subjects. The search functionality can be used to find specific tools or action items like powershell modules or \*.bat, it's not just a video reference.

Great Videos to Check Out

- "APT's Love PowerShell, You Should Too" from DEFCON SafeMode is an excellent watch for a dive into how adversaries utilize PowerShell for exploitation. Anthony and Jake do a great job of breaking down what defenses are bypassed and even show you a few tips and tricks you can utilize.
- "PowerShell For Pentesting" was presented at KringleCon 2018 by Mick Douglas provides an interesting look at how you can take basic PowerShell tasks and weaponize them for Pentesting.
- "PowerShell & Under The Wire" John Hammond goes over a cool platform called UnderTheWire, where you can practice your PowerShell Kung-Fu.

The videos above can help provide you with great follow on training and references showing how powerful CLI usage on Windows is.

Writers and Blogs To Follow

- Microsoft's Training Documentation is an interesting and great resource for those looking for a deeper dive into Powershell usage.
- Black Hills Information Security writes quite a bit about PowerShell, Command Prompt usage, and exploitation, among other things. Their content is excellent, and they have a breadth of blog posts to absorb.
- SANS Has a great blog set that details the usage of many PowerShell and CMD components. As a bonus, this webcast on the use of PowerShell in Pentesting is worth the watch.

Closing Thoughts
Being proficient with different operating systems CLI's is a must for any aspiring pentester, sysadmin, and many other roles. When dealing with Windows environments, you will inevitably have to use PowerShell or CMD at some point. As a pentester, being able to import your own modules, reference, and take advantage of built-in tools to acquire information, elevate privileges, persist on a host, and live off the land, if you will, is an invaluable skill. Keep practicing your CLI usage, and you will be a master in no time.

Thanks for following along on this adventure, and keep on learning!
